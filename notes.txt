MAKE A PLAN
Implement Search Feature
1. Write a test (if we were doing TDD (Test Driven Development) we'd start with this!)
2. Make a search form - one input field and button that submits a url structured like this /search?term=pooodle
3. Make a /search route that responds with a template pets-search.html (we'll just reuse the pets-index.pug template)
4. Make the /search route actually search using our Pet model.

Tools:
- Bootstrap 4 navbar form( search ): https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/#forms
- HTMl Converter:https://html2jade.org/

Search Route (bug fix - helpful resource):

1. We are going to add pagination to the `/` and `/search` routes first and those both
use the pets-index.pug template, so we can use bootstrap's pagination snippet to
start that.

2. Next we need to add the mongoose-paginate module to extend Mongoose with
pagination methods to only return pages of 10 pets.

3. Finally we need to write a test for both routes so that we can ship it!
