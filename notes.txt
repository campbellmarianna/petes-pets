MAKE A PLAN
1. Write a test (if we were doing TDD (Test Driven Development) we'd start with this!)
2. Make a search form - one input field and button that submits a url structured like this /search?term=pooodle
3. Make a /search route that responds with a template pets-search.html (we'll just reuse the pets-index.pug template)
4. Make the /search route actually search using our Pet model.
